There is some confusion for me about the difference between the EscapeRoom.java file that my partner Avinash originally added to our GitHub and the smaller version (which I named as EscapeRoom2.java) that I later downloaded directly from the official PLTW starter ZIP. The version Avinash added has around 126 lines and already includes most of the game’s functionality such as movement, traps, jumps, replay, help menus, and scoring. The version I downloaded from PLTW has about 85 lines (after I added my own game control code) and seems to be a simpler starter template meant for students to build from. Because of the size difference and overlap in purpose, I’m still not sure which version I’m actually supposed to be using or modifying for this project.
