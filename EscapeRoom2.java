      right, left, up, down: move player size of move, m, if player try to go off grid or bump into wall, score decreases
      jump over 1 space: player cannot jump over walls
      pick up prize: score increases, if there is no prize, penalty
      help: display all possible commands
      end: reach the far right wall, score increase, game ends, if game ends without reaching far right wall, penalty
      replay: shows number of player steps and resets the board, player or another player can play the same board
        
      if player land on a trap, spring a trap to increase score: the program must first check if there is a trap, if none exists, penalty
      Note that you must adjust the score with any method that returns a score
      Optional: create a custom image for player - use the file player.png on disk
